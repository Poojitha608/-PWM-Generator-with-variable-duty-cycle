# -PWM-Generator-with-variable-duty-cycle
Designed and implemented a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal generator with a variable duty cycle, controlled in real-time via a PMOD keyboard interface. This project was chosen to bridge core digital logic design principles with practical hardware implementation, making it an ideal application of VLSI design and FPGA programming skills.
